# Generators Inside Out

This is a hands-on workshop that provides in-depth introduction to generators in Python.

Using lot of examples and exercises, this workshop introduces the idea of generators in depth with emphasis on the new style of programming that generators makes possible. We'll also see how to build a cooperative multi-threading library using generators and explore the new async and await constructs of Python 3.
