# HTTP Bottom Up

There are many popular modern web frameworks. While these frameworks make it easy
to get started with developing web applications, they hide lot of details that
are required to understand how the whole thing is working together.

HTTP Bottom Up is a hands-on workshop that explores building web applications
starting all the way from bare sockets, without using any framework. Even
though this is not the most production way to build web applications, 
this exercise will give a chance to observe and understand everything that
happens behind the scenes of any web application.

The workshop uses Python 3 for all the examples and exercises.

## Target Audience

The course is designed for professional software developers involved in developing web applications.

This course assumes that the participants already have decent experience in building web applications and familiarity with Python programming language.

## Outline

**The Internet**

- Introduction to the key ideas behind the Internet, including IP address,
  domain name, ports and sockets.

**Internet Applications**

- Introduciton to client-server architecture
- Study of popular internet applications like SMTP, NTP, DNS etc. 
- Building Internet applications
- Concurrency patterns (multi-threading, multi-processing and async)

**The World Wide Web**

- Understanding URIs and Hypertext
- Deep dive into HTTP
- Exploring HTTP methods, status codes and using curl and netcat

<br/>

**Building an HTTP client**

Write a program to:

* crawl web pages 
* submit forms
* extract information from web pages

**Building an HTTP server**

Build a web server from scratch that supports:

- serving static files
- CGI

**Python WSGI**

- Writing Simple WSGI applications
- Implement a WSGI server

**Building a web framework**

Build a web framework from scratch containing the following features:

- routing system
- utilities to read query string
- access HTTP headers
- read POST input
- handle cookies and sessions

**Best Practices and Scalability Considerations**

- Discussion on best practices including REST
- Discussion on scalability

## Duration and Format

The suggested duration of the course is 2 days. The duration can be extended
to 3 days to cover some additional topics, if required.

This is an interactive course and it is suggested to limit the number of
participants to 15 or less for it to be effective.

The class time is spent on live demonstration of concepts using examples and
hands-on programming exercises. 

## Required Arrangements

The class room will require a video projector and a white board.

A computer with internet connection is required for each participant. The computers must have Python 3.5 preinstalled.
